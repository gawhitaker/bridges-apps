# bridges-apps
Improved bridge constructs for stochastic differential equations - applications

R code to recreate the applications within the paper. 

The R code to run each application is contained in app_*.r
The commands in these scripts are the only ones needed to run an application.

helper_*.r contains helper functions for each application (sourced in app*.r)
